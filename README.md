MyFoodWebApp was our end-semester project for the course "Introduction to Information and Communication Technology."  
𝐆𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬:
Our main goal was to use HTML5 and CSS3 to build a meal ordering web app with five pages: login, home, menu, offers, and cart. We implemented newer concepts for both of these technologies. Flex-boxes and CSS3 variables were among them. We at first brainstormed different design ideas before putting them into use. 
𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬:
We accepted this as a challenge and created the whole website within the time span specified by our lecturer, Ms Madiha Umer. We learned more about the front-end and how different technologies interact with one another, during this project.
